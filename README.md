Minigame game is a game where you play a series of minigames that get faster and more difficult as you go until you lose 4 lives. This is a port of a game made in scratch to unity inspired by the warioware series.

There are currently 6 implemented games
-Square the Circle
  Using the arrow keys you must direct a circle around so that it touches all the squares
-Catch the Droplet
  Using left and right you must move a tray to catch a falling drop of water
-Sudoku
  Using 1-9 you must choose a number so that all the numbers in the square are unique
-Fly Swat
  Using space you must swat the fly as it flies across the screen
-Space Game
  A bullet hell game featuring an enemy that shoots at you and falling meteors
-City Defence
  A tower defence game where you must kill the enemies before they touch the city in the middle.

The focus of this project was to make something that was easily expandable and allowed for lots of reusability so that new minigames can be created and added easily.
